# scrapeLOL
Quick web scraper I made in order to get the results from a esports league I am a fan of. 

Since competitive LPL (chinese) games were at inconvenient times for me (around 3 - 5 AM), I made this webscraper so I could wake up and call it to quickly see the results as they tweet out the daily results after the games have concluded.
