# scrapeLOL
Web scraper built with Python using Tweepy to access the Twitter API. 
This small project saves me about 10 - 15 minutes of meaningless scrolling each day because I can run the script with multiple accounts (so can you!) and get the tweets I want. 
## Motivation
I've been a big fan of competitive League of Legends for a majority of my life now and watching the highest level which is currently the Chinese league was impractical due to games starting around 3 - 5 AM. I decided to make a webscraper which will gather the tweets of the results using python in order to see which teams had won.
